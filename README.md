# Automatic-pressure-cooker-alerter


- We have observed that cooks generally face the problem of miscounting the number of whistles of a pressure cooker, which leads to uncooked or over cooked food leading to wastage of food.

- Under or over cooked food also reduces the taste. (user has a bad experience eating that food)

- So we surveyed people around our homes to see what their problems are.. they said that it would be nice if there was a system which would notify the user when the number of whistles reaches a certain threshold.

- So we did exactly that..
- we used,
- 
        - a microphone sensor to sense the sound of a whistle
        - an Arduino to keep track of the number of whistles and notify the user
        - a buzzer to notify the user using a loud sound
        - Future Scope: a Bluetooth module to send a notification to the user that the whistles have reached their count
